**Email #1: Agency Trading Desk Director**

Subject: AR advertising platform for [Agency] clients

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Agency] was behind [Notable Campaign] - impressive work on [specific element].

I'm reaching out because we've built something your clients will want: the first programmatic platform for AR advertising. Think DOOH, but visible only through AR glasses like Meta Orion - launching Q2 2025.

Early campaigns are seeing 3-5x engagement vs traditional DOOH, with direct attribution to store visits. We're working with properties like [Notable Property] in LA and NYC.

Would you have 15 minutes next week for a quick overview? Happy to show you the platform and discuss how [Agency] clients might benefit.

Best,
[Name]
[Calendar Link]

P.S. Attaching a one-pager with the basics. Would love your thoughts.

**Email #2: Follow-up with Value**

Subject: Re: AR advertising platform for [Agency] clients

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note last week about spatial advertising.

I thought you might find this interesting: we just completed a campaign with [Brand/Category] that delivered a 4.2x engagement lift vs their DOOH benchmark and drove 18% increase in foot traffic to nearby stores.

The full case study is here: [Link]

Still interested in a brief conversation? I'm in [City] next week if an in-person demo would be more convenient.

Best,
[Name]

**Email #3: Video Demo**

Subject: 3-min video demo of AR advertising platform

Hi [Name],

I know you're busy, so I recorded a quick 3-minute demo of our platform:

[Video Link]

The TLDR:
- Programmatic AR advertising at premium properties
- 3-5x higher engagement than DOOH
- Full attribution and measurement
- Familiar buying process (via Trade Desk, DV360, etc.)

If it's interesting, let's find 15 minutes to discuss how [Agency] could use it for [Client Type] clients.

Best,
[Name]

**Break-up Email:**

Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about SpatialRights' AR advertising platform but haven't heard back. I don't want to be a pest!

Should I assume this isn't a priority for [Agency] right now and close your file?

Or is it just bad timing? If so, when should I follow up?

Either way, thanks for your time.

Best,
[Name]

*(This often generates a response - "not a bad time, just busy...")*

*If no:*

*Next 15 minutes: SpatialRights Overview*

**The Pitch:**

*Hook (1 min):*
"Let me start with the 'why' - AR glasses like Meta Orion are launching this year, and by 2027 there will be 50M+ people walking around seeing the world through AR. That creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity: advertising in the real world with the engagement of digital."

*Problem (2 min):*
"Today's DOOH is limited - it's static, can't target, and you're competing with 100 other billboards for attention. Digital mobile gets attention but it's oversaturated and people are tired of being tracked. There's a gap: how do you reach premium audiences in the real world with engaging, measurable experiences?"

*Solution (5 min):*
"That's what SpatialRights does. We've partnered with premium properties - [Examples in their market] - and we're giving advertisers like you the ability to place AR advertising that only AR glass users see.

Here's what makes it different:
- **Engagement:** 3-5x higher than DOOH because it's immersive and interactive
- **Targeting:** Location-based, contextual, and audience data from DMPs
- **Measurement:** Full attribution to store visits, app installs, conversions
- **Familiar:** Buy programmatically through Trade Desk, DV360, etc.
- **Premium:** Curated properties, brand-safe environments"

*Proof (3 min):*
"We've run [X] campaigns so far. One example: [Brand] did a [campaign] at [property] and saw [results]. Another: [Brand] used AR to [use case] and achieved [outcome]."

*How It Works (4 min):*
[Show platform demo or walkthrough]
- Campaign planning and property selection
- Creative production (we help with this)
- Media buying (programmatic or direct)
- Real-time measurement and optimization

*Final 10 minutes: Discovery Close*

**Assessment Questions:**
- "How does this compare to what you expected?"
- "Can you see this working for [specific client or campaign]?"
- "What concerns or questions do you have?"
- "What would you need to see to move forward?"

**Next Steps:**
- "Based on what you've shared, I think [specific recommendation]."
- "The logical next step would be [demo/proposal/case study review]."
- "I'd like to [specific action]. Can we schedule that for [specific time]?"

**Exit Criteria:**
- Demonstrated clear value for their situation
- Identified specific use case or opportunity

Subject: AR Advertising Proposal for [Client/Campaign]

Hi [Name],

Thanks again for taking the time to review SpatialRights last week. It was great to discuss [specific topic from meeting].

As promised, I've put together a proposal for [specific campaign or objective]. The recommendation is based on what you shared about [their goals], and I think it's a strong fit.

Here's what I'm proposing:
- **Campaign:** [Brief description]
- **Properties:** [Key locations]
- **Investment:** [Total budget]
- **Expected Results:** [Key outcomes]

Full proposal attached. I'd love to walk through it with you - are you available [Day] or [Day] for 30 minutes?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
[Name]

---

*Follow-up:*

- Day 5: Schedule proposal review call if not yet scheduled
- Day 7: Follow-up call/email pushing for decision timeline
- Day 10: Address any outstanding questions or concerns
- Day 14: Check-in on status and next steps

**Proposal Review Meeting:**

*Agenda (30-45 minutes):*

1. **Recap Objectives (5 min):**
   - Remind them of stated goals
   - Confirm still relevant

2. **Walk Through Proposal (15 min):**
   - Highlight key elements
   - Explain rationale for recommendations
   - Show expected outcomes and ROI

3. **Q&A and Objection Handling (15 min):**
   - Address questions and concerns
   - Negotiate if needed (see below)
   - Build confidence in decision

4. **Close or Next Steps (10 min):**
   - Ask for the business: "Are you ready to move forward?"
   - If yes: Get to contract execution
   - If no: Understand what's blocking, propose path to yes

**Negotiation Tactics:**

**Common Negotiation Points:**

**1. Price / Budget:**

*Prospect:* "The price is higher than our typical DOOH."

*Response:*
"I hear you. Let's talk about value vs price. Traditional DOOH delivers [X] engagement rate. Our campaigns deliver 3-5x that. So on a cost-per-engagement basis, AR is actually more efficient. Plus you get full attribution to store visits, which DOOH can't offer. Would you be open to testing at this investment, and then we can optimize based on performance?"

*Compromise Options:*
- Reduce flight length or number of properties (maintain CPM)
- Offer performance guarantee ("If we don't hit X engagement rate, we'll extend campaign free")
- Package deal (commit to 2-3 campaigns, discount 10%)

*Walk-Away:* Don't discount below 15% - damages positioning and sets bad precedent

**2. Performance Guarantee:**

*Prospect:* "How do I know this will work? Can you guarantee results?"

*Response:*
"I appreciate you want certainty. Here's what we can do: We'll guarantee that engagement rates are at least 2x your DOOH benchmark. If we fall short, we'll [extend campaign/provide additional impressions/refund difference]. That said, our average is 3-5x, so I'm confident we'll exceed that threshold. Does that give you comfort?"

*Guarantee Options:*
- Engagement rate guarantee (2x DOOH minimum)
- Impression delivery guarantee (we deliver promised impressions)
- Viewability guarantee (70%+ viewable impressions)

*Walk-Away:* Don't guarantee sales or conversions (too many variables outside our control)

**3. Test/Pilot Request:**

*Prospect:* "We'd like to start with a small test before committing to a full campaign."

*Response:*
"That's smart. Most of our clients start with a pilot. Here's what I'd recommend: [Smaller version of proposal] for [reduced investment]. That gives you enough data to see engagement, attribution, and ROI, but keeps investment manageable. If it performs, we can scale to [full campaign]. Sound reasonable?"

*Pilot Structure:*
- 1-2 properties vs 3-5
- 4-week flight vs 8-12 weeks
- $25-50K investment vs $75-150K
- All measurement and reporting included
- Clear criteria for continuation

*Caution:* Ensure pilot is substantial enough to generate meaningful results. A $10K test at one property won't prove anything.

**4. Contract Terms:**

*Prospect:* "We can't commit to [contract length / cancellation terms / payment schedule]."

*Response:*
[Understand their concern first]
"Help me understand - what's the concern with [specific term]?"

[Then address]
"I see. Here's the challenge on our side: [explain our perspective]. What if we [compromise proposal]?"

*Compromise Options:*
- Payment terms: 50% upfront / 50% on launch → 33% upfront / 33% midpoint / 34% completion
- Cancellation: 30-day notice → 15-day notice with 50% fee
- Contract length: 12 months → 6 months with renewal option

**5. Creative Production:**

*Prospect:* "We want to use our own agency for creative."

*Response:*
"Absolutely, happy to collaborate. We'll need to provide AR technical specifications and QA the final assets to ensure they render properly. Our team can serve as technical consultants throughout the process. To streamline, we typically do a kickoff workshop with your agency to share best practices. Does that work?"

*Options:*
- We produce: Included in package or $15-25K
- They produce with our support: Technical specs and QA included, consultation $5K
- Their agency produces: We QA and traffic, $2-3K fee

**Closing Techniques:**

**Assumptive Close:**
"Great, let's get started. I'll send over the contract today. Who should be copied on it?"

**Alternative Close:**
"Do you prefer to start [Date 1] or [Date 2]?" (assumes they're moving forward, just choosing timing)

**Summary Close:**
"Let me recap what we've agreed to: [Campaign details]. Correct? Okay, let's move to contract execution."

**Direct Close:**
"Based on everything we've discussed, are you ready to move forward?"

**Urgency Close:**
"To hit your [product launch / event / seasonal] timing, we'd need to start creative production by [date]. Can we get the contract signed this week?"

**Exit Criteria:**
- Agreement on campaign approach, budget, and timeline
- Contract sent for signature
- Decision timeline confirmed
- Clear next steps if not immediate close

*For Mixed Results:*
"Thanks for partnering with us on [campaign]. While we hit [successes], I know [challenge] didn't meet expectations. I've put together some thoughts on how we can improve for a follow-up campaign. Can we discuss?"

*Approach:*
- Acknowledge what didn't work
- Take ownership (where appropriate)
- Present plan to improve
- Offer incentive (discount, bonus inventory)

**Expansion Strategies:**

**1. Additional Properties:**
"You saw great results at [Property A]. I think [Property B and C] would perform even better based on [rationale]. What if we added those for [campaign]?"

**2. New Markets:**
"Your LA campaign was successful. Want to expand to New York and Miami for a national presence?"

**3. Annual Commitment:**
"Instead of planning quarterly, what if we secured your AR inventory for the full year? I can offer [discount/priority access/enhanced support] for an annual commitment."

**4. Programmatic Buying:**
"You've tested with managed campaigns. Ready to bring AR advertising in-house through Trade Desk? We can set that up and train your team."

**Referral Strategy:**

**When to Ask:**
- After successful campaign
- After positive feedback or testimonial
- During renewal conversations
- At the end of positive interactions

**How to Ask:**
"I'm so glad the campaign was successful. We're looking to work with more brands in [category]. Do you know anyone at [Company A] or [Company B] who might be interested? Happy to mention you made the introduction."

**Incentives:**
- 5% discount on next campaign for successful referral
- Public recognition (if desired)
- Early access to new features/properties

**Exit Criteria:**
- Renewal contract signed OR
- Clear understanding of why not renewing (learnings for future)
- Referral introductions made
- Case study completed and published
- Customer relationship maintained for future opportunities

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections and Responses

**Objection 1: "AR glasses aren't mainstream yet."**

*Response:*
"You're right that we're early. That's actually the opportunity. Here's why timing matters:

1. **First-mover advantage:** Be first in AR and you'll generate PR, social sharing, and industry recognition. That's worth more than the media investment.

2. **Lock in premium inventory:** We're offering exclusive access to top properties now. In 12-18 months when AR is mainstream, that inventory will be more expensive and competitive.

3. **Learn and optimize:** Start now while cost is lower, learn what works, and be ready to scale when adoption hits inflection point.

That said, if you're purely focused on reach today, you're right - wait 12-18 months. But if you're looking for innovation, engagement, and competitive positioning, now is the time."

**Objection 2: "It's too expensive compared to DOOH."**

*Response:*
"Let's talk about cost per engagement, not cost per impression. Traditional DOOH gets 2-3% engagement (people who actually look at the ad). Our AR ads get 60-80% engagement because they're immersive and interactive.

So if DOOH is $30 CPM and we're $75 CPM, but we deliver 10x engagement, we're actually 3x more cost-efficient.

Plus, we provide full attribution to store visits and conversions. DOOH can't do that. So you're paying more per impression but getting dramatically more value per dollar spent.

That said, if pure reach is your goal, DOOH is cheaper. But if engagement and attribution matter, AR is more efficient."

**Objection 3: "We don't have AR creative assets."**

*Response:*
"That's common, and we've built our process around that. We have three options:

1. **We produce for you:** Our creative team will develop AR assets based on your existing brand materials. Typical cost: $15-25K, included in many packages.

2. **We collaborate with your agency:** We provide technical specs and best practices, your agency creates, we QA and traffic. Works great for brands with strong in-house creative.

3. **We adapt existing assets:** If you have 3D models (from product renders, video game assets, etc.), we can often adapt those. Lowest cost, fastest timeline.

Most clients choose option 1 for first campaign, then transition to option 2 once they learn AR creative. Which sounds best for you?"

**Objection 4: "How do I measure ROI?"**

*Response:*
"Great question. We measure AR advertising the same way you measure other channels - with a few additions:

**Standard Metrics:**
- Impressions and viewable impressions
- Engagement rate (% who interact)
- Click-through rate (% who tap CTA)
- Completion rate (for video elements)

**AR-Specific Metrics:**
- Dwell time (how long people engage with AR experience)
- 3D interaction (% who rotate/explore object)
- Social sharing (screenshots, shares)

**Attribution:**
- Store visit attribution (foot traffic increase)
- App installs or web visits
- Conversion tracking (purchases, sign-ups)

We provide a real-time dashboard with all these metrics, plus weekly reports and a comprehensive post-campaign analysis. We can also run brand lift studies (before/after surveys) for [additional cost].

What specific ROI metrics matter most to you?"

**Objection 5: "We need to see more case studies/proof."**

*Response:*
"Totally fair. We're early, so we don't have 100 case studies. But here's what we do have:

[Share 2-3 most relevant case studies]

And here's what I'd propose: Let's structure your campaign as a proof-of-concept with clear success criteria. If we hit [specific benchmarks], you commit to [larger campaign]. If we fall short, [consequence - refund, extended campaign, whatever makes sense].

That way you're not taking our word for it - we're putting our money where our mouth is. Does that give you enough confidence to move forward?"

**Objection 6: "We're in annual planning mode, can't do anything until next year."**

*Response:*
"I understand. Annual planning is [Q3/Q4], right?

Here's why I'd encourage you to consider testing sooner:

1. **You'll have data for annual planning:** A Q2/Q3 pilot gives you real performance data to justify a bigger investment in next year's plan.

2. **Innovation budgets:** Most brands have some innovation or test budget outside the annual plan. Even a $50K pilot can generate valuable insights.

3. **Competitive timing:** Your competitors may move faster. Being first in AR has PR value beyond the media investment.

What if we structured a pilot campaign now, specifically to generate data for your annual planning? That way you're going into planning with proof, not a pitch."

**Objection 7: "We need legal/procurement approval and it takes months."**

*Response:*
"Understood. I've worked with [Similar Company] and their procurement process. Here's how we can accelerate:

1. **Standard contract:** We have a standard agreement that's been reviewed by [X] companies. That speeds up legal review.

2. **Procurement packet:** We can provide all vendor documentation upfront (insurance, financials, references, etc.) so there's no back-and-forth.

3. **Parallel process:** While procurement runs, we can start creative development and planning under an NDA. That way when contract is signed, we're ready to launch immediately.

Typically this cuts 4-6 weeks off the timeline. When does your legal team need the contract to review?"

**Objection 8: "We want to work directly with properties, not through a platform."**

*Response:*
"I understand wanting a direct relationship. Let me explain why the platform model benefits you:

1. **Scale and efficiency:** We aggregate 15+ properties. You get access to all with one contract, one IO, one invoice. Direct would mean 15 separate negotiations.

2. **Technology:** Properties don't have AR ad tech. We provide campaign management, targeting, measurement, reporting. Direct would require you to build all that.

3. **Programmatic access:** Our platform integrates with Trade Desk, DV360, etc. You can buy AR ads the same way you buy display. Direct relationships can't offer that.

4. **Support:** We provide creative production, campaign optimization, troubleshooting. Properties aren't set up to offer that level of service.

Think of us like Spotify. You could negotiate directly with every artist, or use Spotify for access to the whole catalog with one subscription. We're Spotify for AR advertising.

That said, if you have a specific property relationship you want to activate, we can potentially co-develop that. Would that be interesting?"
