# Property Acquisition Strategy

## Executive Summary

Property acquisition is the foundation of the SpatialRights marketplace. Without premium properties, we have no inventory to sell to advertisers. However, property owners are unfamiliar with AR rights, skeptical of new revenue streams, and concerned about brand control. Our strategy overcomes these barriers through guaranteed minimum revenue, turnkey technical implementation, and clear legal frameworks that protect property owners while establishing our market position.

The key insight: property owners will sign when we eliminate all risk and provide upside. We achieve this through revenue guarantees, creative control provisions, and educational materials that help them understand the opportunity cost of not participating.

**Year 1 Objectives:**
- Sign 15-20 premium properties across 3 launch markets
- Achieve 100% retention through exceptional service
- Establish legal precedent for AR property rights
- Create property owner advocacy and referral network
- Generate $500K in property revenue (against $1.5M guarantees)

**Budget:** $1.8M
- Revenue guarantees: $1.5M (15 properties × $100K average)
- Legal framework development: $150K
- Property onboarding technology: $100K
- Sales team and marketing: $50K

## Understanding Property Owner Psychology

### What Property Owners Care About

**Primary Concerns:**

**1. Revenue Reliability**
- Guaranteed income vs speculative revenue
- Comparison to existing lease rates
- Payment terms and collection risk
- Long-term value vs one-time experimental program

- Approval process for advertisers and creative
- Ability to reject inappropriate content
- Impact on property reputation and tenant relationships

**3. Operational Burden**
- Technical implementation complexity

- Liability and legal exposure

**4. Competitive Positioning**

- PR value and community perception

**5. Opportunity Cost**
- Is this the right partner for AR rights?
- Are they giving up more valuable future opportunities?
- Contract length and exclusivity implications
- Exit options if better offer comes along

## Legal Framework and Contract Terms

### AR Property Rights: Legal Foundation

**The Core Legal Question:**

Do property owners have the right to control augmented reality overlays visible in/around their physical property?

**Legal Precedent and Framework:**

**1. Airspace Rights**
- Property owners control airspace above their property (within limits)
- AR overlays are digital, but tied to physical location
- Analogy: Building can't control airplane billboards, but can control building-mounted signage

**2. Trademark and Trade Dress**
- Property owners can protect distinctive appearance (trade dress)
- Unauthorized commercial use of property image may violate trademark
- Example: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame sued photographer for selling building images

**3. Publicity Rights**
- Some jurisdictions protect commercial use of property images
- Stronger for iconic/recognizable properties
- Varies significantly by state

**4. Trespass and Virtual Overlays**
- Traditional trespass law doesn't clearly apply to AR
- Pokemon Go lawsuits established property owners can prohibit AR gaming
- Commercial AR advertising likely requires permission

**Our Legal Position:**

"Property owners control commercial AR advertising rights in the same way they control physical signage rights. SpatialRights acts as the property owner's exclusive agent for monetizing these rights."

*Investment:* $150K (Year 1)

*Activities:*
- Retain leading real estate and technology law firm

Subject: AR advertising opportunity at [Property Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to discuss a significant new revenue opportunity for [Property Name].

SpatialRights has developed the first platform for AR advertising in the real world - think of it as digital billboards visible only through AR glasses like Meta's new Orion. We're launching in [Market] and believe [Property Name] would be an ideal anchor property.

What makes this compelling:
• Guaranteed minimum revenue ($50K-$150K annually, no downside)
• Zero operational burden (we handle all technical implementation)
• Complete creative control (you approve all advertisers and content)
• Valuable foot traffic analytics (understand your visitor patterns)

We're working with [Notable Property Example] and other premium locations. Given the exclusive nature of these agreements, I'd love to share more details with you before we finalize other properties in the area.

### Property Performance Optimization

**Fill Rate Optimization:**

If property underperforming (below 40% fill rate):

**Diagnosis:**
- Is foot traffic lower than expected?
- Are AR device adoption rates lagging?
- Is creative/advertiser mix not resonating?
- Are there technical issues?

**Actions:**
- Adjust pricing (lower CPM if needed to drive volume)
- Increase advertiser outreach for this property
- Create property-specific campaign packages
- Enhanced promotion of AR experiences on-property
- Consider temporary promotions or bonuses

**Expansion Opportunities:**

For high-performing properties:

**Additional AR Zones:**
- Identify new locations on property
- Seasonal or event-specific zones
- Indoor vs outdoor expansion
- Higher-traffic areas

**Enhanced Experiences:**
- Interactive AR (not just ads)
- Gamification elements
- Social sharing features
- Wayfinding and property services

**Referral Program:**

Satisfied property owners are best source of new properties:

**Incentive Structure:**
- 5% of first-year revenue from referred property
- Recognition in marketing materials
- Early access to new features
- Annual "Property Partner of the Year" award

**Making Referrals Easy:**
- Referral link in dashboard
- Email templates for introductions
- Co-pitch meetings with prospects
- Case study featuring their property

### Renewal Strategy

**Renewal Timeline:**

**Month 30 (6 months before renewal decision):**

- 5% - Change of ownership/management
- 0% - Dissatisfaction (should be preventable with good account management)

## Budget and Economics

**Year 1 Property Acquisition Budget: $1.8M**

Breakdown:
- Revenue guarantees: $1.5M (15 properties × $100K average)
- Legal and contracts: $150K
  - Law firm retainer: $100K
  - Contract development: $25K
  - Individual property legal: $25K
- Technology and onboarding: $100K
  - AR zone mapping tools: $30K
  - Property dashboard: $40K
  - Hardware/beacons: $30K
- Team and operations: $50K
  - VP Property Partnerships (allocated portion): $35K
  - Travel and meetings: $15K

**Expected Year 1 Revenue from Properties:**

Conservative: $500K (assuming slow AR adoption)
Expected: $750K (assuming moderate adoption)
Optimistic: $1M (assuming strong adoption)

**Year 1 Net: -$1M to -$1.3M** (expected loss, covered by funding)

**Year 2 Projections:**

Assumptions:
- 15 existing properties retained
- 15 new properties added (30 total)
- 3x revenue per property (AR adoption accelerates)
- Reduced guarantees ($500K total for underperformers)

**Revenue:** $2.5M
**Guarantees:** $500K
**Overhead:** $200K
**Net:** +$1.8M (profitable!)

**Year 3 Projections:**

Assumptions:
- 30 existing properties (90% retention)
- 30 new properties (60 total)
- 2x revenue growth per property
- Minimal guarantees ($100K total)

**Revenue:** $10M
**Guarantees:** $100K
**Overhead:** $400K
**Net:** +$9.5M (highly profitable)

**Property-Level Unit Economics (Steady State):**

**Premium Property (1M annual visitors):**
- Annual revenue: $150K
- SpatialRights net (70%): $105K
- Property net (30%): $45K
- SpatialRights costs (support, tech): $5K
- **SpatialRights profit per property: $100K annually**

**50 properties at steady state = $5M annual profit contribution**

This is why property acquisition, despite front-loaded investment, is such a valuable moat.

## Key Success Factors

### What Makes Property Acquisition Work

**1. Risk Elimination**

Property owners sign when there's zero downside. Guaranteed minimum revenue removes risk and makes decision easy.

**2. Operational Simplicity**

We handle everything. Property owners just need to provide access and approve campaigns. Low operational burden means fewer reasons to say no.

**3. Creative Control**

Property owners fear loss of control over their brand. Clear approval rights and brand safety protections address this concern.

**4. Proof and Social Proof**

First properties are hardest. Once we have 3-5 marquee properties, others follow ("if The Grove signed, we should too").

**5. Relationship and Trust**

Real estate is a relationship business. Investing time in building trust with property decision-makers pays off.

**6. Speed and Urgency**

First-mover advantage matters. Property owners who sign early get better terms and exclusive positioning. Create urgency.

**7. Long-term Partnership Mindset**

Treat property owners as partners, not vendors. Their success is our success. Over-deliver on promises.

### Common Failure Modes to Avoid

**1. Over-promising Revenue**

Don't inflate projections to win deals. Under-promise and over-deliver. Disappointed property owners don't renew.

**2. Poor Communication**

Radio silence between quarterly reviews creates anxiety. Proactive communication (even when news is not great) builds trust.

**3. Technical Issues**

Platform bugs or downtime damages credibility. Invest in QA and 24/7 support. Fix issues immediately.

**4. Creative Approval Delays**

Slow campaign approvals frustrate advertisers and reduce fill rate. Streamline approval process and set SLAs.

**5. Lack of Transparency**

Hidden fees, unclear reporting, or confusing revenue calculations destroy trust. Radical transparency in all dealings.

**6. Treating Properties as Commodities**

Each property is unique with different needs and concerns. Cookie-cutter approach fails. Customize relationship.

**7. Inadequate Guarantees**

Under-funding guarantees to preserve capital backfires if properties don't perform. Honor commitments always.

## Conclusion

Property acquisition is the foundation of the SpatialRights business. Without premium properties, we have no product to sell to advertisers. The strategy outlined here solves the cold-start problem through guaranteed revenue that eliminates property owner risk while establishing exclusive relationships before AR advertising becomes competitive.

Success requires:
- **Front-loaded investment** ($1.5M in guarantees) to seed the supply side
- **Relationship-focused sales** (real estate is relationship business)
- **Operational excellence** (be the easiest partner property owners have)
- **Long-term thinking** (first year is investment, years 2-3 are payoff)

The 15-20 properties signed in Year 1 become the foundation for a 100+ property network by Year 3, generating $10M+ in annual revenue with high margins and strong defensibility through exclusive contracts.

**Immediate Next Steps (Month 1):**

1. **Finalize target property list** - Specific properties in each launch market
2. **Develop legal framework** - Engage law firm, create model contract
3. **Create property pitch materials** - Deck, one-pager, demo video
4. **Warm introduction outreach** - Leverage network for top 10 properties
5. **Hire VP Property Partnerships** - Critical role for relationship sales
6. **Order AR demo devices** - Meta Orion glasses for property demos
7. **Set up property dashboard** - Analytics and reporting for property owners

The property acquisition strategy works hand-in-hand with advertiser acquisition - both must progress simultaneously to create the two-sided marketplace. With properties secured, we can confidently approach advertisers with real inventory. With advertiser demand building, we can approach properties with revenue proof.

This is the choreography that solves the chicken-and-egg problem.
