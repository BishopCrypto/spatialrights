# Advertiser Acquisition Strategy

## Executive Summary

Acquiring advertisers for AR advertising requires overcoming three fundamental barriers: unfamiliarity with the medium, lack of existing creative assets, and difficulty fitting AR into established media planning processes. Our strategy addresses each barrier through education, creative enablement, and seamless integration with existing workflows.

Rather than direct brand outreach, we'll primarily work through media agencies who control 80%+ of advertising budgets above $500K. We'll position AR advertising as a natural evolution of DOOH - familiar buying mechanisms with breakthrough engagement metrics.

**Year 1 Objectives:**
- Onboard 8-12 advertisers representing $5-10M in committed spend
- Execute 25-30 successful AR campaigns
- Achieve 60%+ fill rate on premium inventory
- Establish 6-8 agency partnerships
- Create 5+ case studies demonstrating ROI

**Budget:** $1.5M
- Agency partnership program: $500K
- Proof campaigns: $500K
- Sales team and tools: $300K
- Events and education: $200K

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Advertiser acquisition for AR advertising requires patience, education, and proof. The strategy outlined here frontloads investment in proof campaigns and agency relationships, recognizing that this is a new category requiring education and trust-building.

Success depends on:
1. **Early Proof:** Self-funded campaigns that demonstrate ROI before asking for advertiser budgets
2. **Agency Leverage:** Partnerships that provide access to multiple brands simultaneously
3. **Category Focus:** Concentrating on high-fit categories (entertainment, automotive, tech) that understand AR
4. **Measurement Rigor:** Proving engagement and attribution through robust measurement frameworks

The 18-24 month window to establish market leadership requires aggressive but focused execution. By month 12, we should have 8-12 active advertisers, strong case studies, and agency partnerships that position us as the default platform for AR advertising as the market scales.

**Immediate Next Steps (Month 1):**

1. **Hire VP Sales** - Critical first hire to drive agency relationships
2. **Develop sales materials** - One-pagers, demo videos, proposal templates
3. **Target agency list finalization** - Identify specific contacts at top 10 agencies
4. **Warm introduction outreach** - Leverage network for agency intros
5. **Proof campaign planning** - Select first 3-4 brand partners for self-funded campaigns
6. **Event strategy finalization** - Commit to CES and other Q1-Q2 events
7. **CRM and sales infrastructure** - Set up Salesforce/HubSpot and processes

The advertiser acquisition strategy works in tandem with property acquisition - both must progress simultaneously to create the two-sided marketplace. The next document (PROPERTY_ACQUISITION.md) details how we secure the inventory that makes advertiser acquisition possible.
