# Launch Sequence and Timeline

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the detailed month-by-month execution plan for bringing SpatialRights to market. The launch sequence is designed to solve the two-sided marketplace challenge through coordinated property acquisition, advertiser education, technical development, and market presence - all timed to create momentum and market leadership.

The strategy follows a phased approach across 18 months:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation** - Build team, secure anchor properties, develop platform, create proof campaigns
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Market Entry** - Launch programmatic, scale property network, grow advertiser base, establish industry presence
- **Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Scale and Optimize** - Expand markets, optimize operations, achieve profitability path, plan national expansion

Success depends on precise choreography: property acquisition must stay ahead of advertiser demand (to ensure inventory), but advertiser demand must materialize quickly enough to prove revenue to properties. This timeline orchestrates that balance.

**18-Month Targets:**
- 20-25 premium properties signed
- $10-15M in advertiser revenue
- 5 programmatic DSP integrations live
- 70%+ fill rate on inventory
- Positive unit economics demonstrated
- 3-4 expansion markets identified and planning initiated

## Critical Path and Dependencies

**Month 5: Proof Campaigns Live**
- If delayed → No case studies for sales → Advertiser acquisition stalls
- Mitigation: Begin creative production Month 3, parallel workstreams

**Month 7: Programmatic Launch**
- If delayed → Can't scale beyond manual sales → Growth limited
- Mitigation: Start SSP conversations Month 1, dedicated engineering team

**Month 9: Series A Closed**

- Mitigation: Begin fundraising Month 6-7, line up lead investor early

### Key Dependencies and Risks

**Property → Advertiser:**

- Buffer: MVP approach, iterate based on real usage

**Programmatic → Scale:**
- Must have programmatic to scale beyond boutique
- Solution: SSP partnership (faster than building)
- Buffer: Direct sales work while programmatic ramps

**Funding → Expansion:**
- Series A required to fund market expansion

## Conclusion

This launch sequence provides the detailed roadmap for bringing SpatialRights from formation to market leadership in 18 months. Success requires:

1. **Precise choreography** - Property acquisition must lead advertiser demand by 3-6 months
2. **Aggressive execution** - No room for delays on critical path milestones
3. **Proof-driven selling** - Self-funded campaigns create credibility before asking for advertiser spend
4. **Technical excellence** - Platform must work flawlessly from Day 1
5. **Strategic fundraising** - Series A by Month 9 is critical to fund expansion

The timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused execution and sufficient capital. By Month 18, SpatialRights should be the undisputed leader in AR advertising with 50+ properties, $25M+ revenue run-rate, and clear path to profitability.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Hire exceptional team (especially VPs)
- Sign anchor properties quickly (months 2-4)
- Execute proof campaigns flawlessly (months 5-6)
- Launch programmatic on time (month 7)
- Close Series A by month 9
- Maintain 90%+ customer retention

The window to establish market leadership is 18-24 months. This launch sequence is designed to capitalize on that window and emerge as the platform for spatial advertising.
