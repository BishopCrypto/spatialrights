# Partnership Strategy

## Executive Summary

Strategic partnerships are force multipliers for SpatialRights. The right partners provide access to customers, technology capabilities, market credibility, and resources that would take years to build organically. This document outlines our partnership strategy across six categories: Platform Partners, Technology Partners, Agency Partners, Data Partners, Property Partners, and Strategic/Corporate Partners.

Our partnership philosophy: **Be the infrastructure, not the application.** We want to be the plumbing that powers AR advertising across platforms, agencies, and properties - not a walled garden competing with potential partners.

**Partnership Objectives (18 Months):**
- 2-3 Platform Partners (Meta, Apple, Snap)
- 3-5 Technology Partners (DSPs, verification, attribution)
- 8-12 Agency Partners (holding companies and specialists)
- 2-3 Data Partners (DMPs, location data)
- 3-5 Property Partners (multi-property groups)
- 1-2 Strategic/Corporate Partners (acquisition prospects or investors)

## Partnership Framework

### Partnership Evaluation Criteria

Every partnership opportunity should be evaluated against these criteria:

**Strategic Fit:**
- Aligns with core business and GTM strategy
- Provides access to target customers or capabilities
- Strengthens competitive moat
- Accelerates time to market or scale

**Mutual Value:**
- Clear value exchange for both parties
- Sustainable over time (not one-sided)
- Measurable success metrics for both sides

**Resource Requirements:**
- Technical integration complexity and timeline
- Business development and relationship management effort
- Legal and contracting overhead
- Ongoing support and maintenance

**Risk Assessment:**
- Dependency risk (do we become too dependent on partner?)
- Competitive risk (could partner become competitor or favor competitor?)
- Reputation risk (partner failure reflects on us)
- Control risk (do we lose control of key assets or relationships?)

**Decision Framework:**

- **Tier 1 (Strategic):** CEO approval required, board visibility
- **Tier 2 (Important):** VP-level approval, CEO informed
- **Tier 3 (Tactical):** VP-level decision, standardized terms

## Platform Partners

### Objective

Partner with AR platform owners (Meta, Apple, Snap) to ensure SpatialRights is integrated into their ecosystems and positioned as the default AR advertising platform.

### Target Partners

**1. Meta (Orion AR Glasses) - HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Why Critical:**
- Orion is first mass-market AR glasses platform (launching 2025)
- Meta has 3B+ users across Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp
- Ray-Ban Meta partnership shows commitment to smart glasses
- Meta Audience Network is massive advertising platform
- Being "official" Meta partner provides credibility and distribution

**Partnership Opportunity:**

*What We Want from Meta:*
- Official integration with Orion AR platform
- Access to Meta Audience Network demand
- Co-marketing and joint go-to-market
- Early access to Orion developer tools and beta hardware
- Preferred partner status (listed in AR app store, developer resources)
- Joint case studies and thought leadership

*What Meta Wants from Us:*
- Third-party validation of AR advertising (they don't want to be only ad network)
- Property owner relationships (Meta doesn't want to negotiate with every property)
- Advertiser education and demand generation (expand AR ad market)
- Best practices and standards development (help establish category)
- Revenue share opportunity (percentage of ad revenue)

**Partnership Structure:**

*Option 1: Preferred Partner (Recommended)*
- Non-exclusive partnership
- We integrate with Orion APIs
- Meta promotes SpatialRights to developers and advertisers
- Revenue share: 10-15% to Meta (on ads served via Orion)
- Co-marketing and thought leadership
- 3-year term with renewal

*Option 2: Acquisition Target*
- Meta acquires SpatialRights
- Become Meta's property-side AR ad platform
- Exit for founders/investors
- Timeline: 18-24 months, after proving model

**Approach Strategy:**

*Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Relationship Building*
- Identify key contacts:
  - Meta Reality Labs leadership (AR platform)
  - Meta Audience Network leadership (advertising)
  - Business development team
- Warm introductions through investors/advisors
- Initial meetings: Share vision, explore alignment

*Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Technical Integration*
- Access Orion developer program
- Build demo applications
- Test AR ad experiences on Orion
- Provide feedback to Meta on platform

*Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Partnership Formalization*
- Propose formal partnership structure
- Negotiate terms and revenue share
- Legal agreement execution
- Joint launch planning

*Phase 4 (Months 13-18): Joint Go-to-Market*
- Co-marketing campaigns
- Joint advertiser education
- Case study development
- Expansion discussions (deeper integration, potential acquisition)

**Key Risks and Mitigations:**

*Risk: Meta builds competing property platform*
- Mitigation: Lock in exclusive property relationships first
- Mitigation: Position as complementary (we handle property side, they handle demand)

*Risk: Meta demands too high revenue share*
- Mitigation: Be willing to walk away, work with Apple/Snap instead
- Mitigation: Show value we provide (property acquisition, advertiser education)

*Risk: Meta favors own ad network over third-party*
- Mitigation: Non-exclusive approach (work with all platforms)
- Mitigation: Property exclusives give us leverage

**Success Metrics:**
- Partnership agreement signed by Month 12
- 50%+ of AR ad impressions served via Orion
- Co-marketing in 3+ campaigns/events
- Meta referring advertisers to SpatialRights

*Option 2: Strategic Partnership*
- Direct partnership with Apple (outside App Store)
- Integrated into Vision Pro system
- Lower or no revenue share
- Deeper technical integration

**Approach Strategy:**

*Challenge:* Apple notoriously difficult to partner with (walled garden)

*Approach:*

- Approach through:
  - Apple Vision Pro team
  - Apple Advertising Platform team (if exists)
  - Business development (enterprise partnerships)

**Timeline:** Months 6-18 (slower than Meta, but important)

**Key Risks:**

- Apple may build own AR advertising platform

**Mitigation:**

- Revenue share: 20-30% to Snap

**Approach Strategy:**

*Advantage:* Snap more partnership-friendly than Meta/Apple

*Approach:*
- Direct outreach to Snap Ads and Spectacles teams
- Position as supply-side partner (we provide inventory)

## Conclusion

Partnerships are not a "nice-to-have" for SpatialRights - they're essential to the strategy. The right partnerships provide:

**Access:** To customers (agencies, advertisers), inventory (properties), and demand (programmatic platforms)

**Credibility:** Association with trusted brands (Meta, Trade Desk, major agencies) validates our category leadership

**Capabilities:** Technology integrations that would take years to build (verification, attribution, data)

**Scale:** Efficient access to large customer bases (agency holding companies, property groups)

**Optionality:** Potential acquirers who see strategic value in what we're building

Our partnership approach is pragmatic and prioritized:
- **Months 1-6:** Foundation partnerships (SSP, Meta, verification)
- **Months 7-12:** Scale partnerships (DSPs, agencies, attribution)
- **Months 13-18:** Expansion partnerships (additional platforms, property groups, data)

Success requires:
- **Strategic clarity:** Know what we want from each partner
- **Mutual value:** Ensure win-win, not one-sided
- **Dedicated resources:** Partnership management is real work
- **Long-term thinking:** Best partnerships take time to develop

The partnerships outlined in this document, if executed well, can 2-3x the value of SpatialRights by accelerating growth, reducing costs, and creating strategic optionality.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Magnite outreach** (Month 1) - Critical for programmatic
2. **Meta relationship building** (Month 1-2) - Start early, long sales cycle
3. **Agency target list** (Month 1) - Identify and prioritize
4. **Verification partner selection** (Month 3-4) - Needed before programmatic scale
5. **Partnership tracking in CRM** (Month 1) - Infrastructure for management
6. **Partnership success metrics** (Month 1) - Define how we measure partnership ROI
