## PATENT PORTFOLIO RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risks
**Moderate Risk:**
- **Prior Art Challenges:** Thorough prior art search conducted, but submarine patents possible
- **Obviousness Rejections:** Some claims may be narrowed during prosecution
- **Competitor Design-Arounds:** Determined competitors may find alternative approaches

**Mitigated Risk:**
- **Implementation Before Filing:** 6+ months of development provides reduction to practice evidence
- **Detailed Specification:** Extensive technical details support claim breadth
- **Multiple Independent Claims:** Layered claim strategy provides fallback positions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Conduct ongoing prior art monitoring
- File continuation applications to capture new innovations
- Maintain trade secret protection for non-patented components
