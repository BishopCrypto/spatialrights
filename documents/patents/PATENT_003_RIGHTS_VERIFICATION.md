# CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED RIGHTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR AUGMENTED REALITY ADVERTISING

## PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

**Application Number:** [To be assigned]
**Filing Date:** October 2024
**Inventors:** Ryan Smith and SpatialRights Development Team
**Title:** Cryptographic Verification and Blockchain-Based Rights Management System for Augmented Reality Advertising

## ABSTRACT

A comprehensive system for verifying, managing, and enforcing exclusive advertising rights for augmented reality content displayed on physical properties using cryptographic signatures, blockchain distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and digital identity verification. The system creates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing exclusive spatial advertising rights with precise boundary definitions, temporal validity periods, and ownership attribution. The invention includes property owner identity verification through government-issued credentials, deed registry cross-referencing, and multi-factor authentication; zone ownership proof through cryptographic hashing and blockchain recording; automated royalty distribution via smart contracts; conflict resolution mechanisms for disputed claims; and real-time rights validation enabling AR content platforms to verify advertising authorization before displaying content. The system prevents unauthorized AR content placement, provides immutable audit trails of rights transfers, and enables fractional ownership models for AR advertising rights securitization.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to digital rights management systems, blockchain-based asset verification, and cryptographic proof-of-ownership mechanisms, specifically applied to augmented reality advertising rights on physical real estate properties.

### Description of Related Art

Traditional property rights are established through government deed registries, title insurance, and legal documentation. These systems are well-suited for physical property ownership but inadequate for novel digital rights like AR advertising space. Existing systems include:

**Government Deed Registries:** County recorder offices maintain paper or digitized records of property ownership transfers. These systems record ownership of physical land and buildings but do not subdivide properties into specific advertising zones, do not recognize AR spatial rights as a distinct asset class, and lack real-time verification mechanisms for digital rights queries.

**Digital Rights Management (DRM) for Media:** Content protection systems (Adobe DRM, Apple FairPlay, Widevine) manage distribution rights for digital media but focus on preventing unauthorized copying rather than proving exclusive spatial advertising rights. They do not incorporate geospatial boundaries, property ownership verification, or blockchain-based provenance.

**NFT Platforms for Digital Art:** OpenSea, Rarible, and similar platforms enable creation and trading of NFTs representing digital artwork and collectibles. However, these platforms do not link NFTs to physical real-world assets, do not verify the seller actually owns the underlying asset being tokenized, and provide no mechanism for validating spatial advertising rights before content display.

**Smart Contract Platforms:** Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchain platforms support programmable smart contracts for automated transactions. While these enable trustless execution of predefined logic, existing implementations do not address the specific requirements of spatial advertising rights: geospatial boundary encoding, temporal validity windows, property owner verification, and integration with AR content delivery systems.

**Certificate Authorities for Digital Signatures:** PKI systems and certificate authorities (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert) provide identity verification for websites and software publishers. However, they verify organizational identity, not ownership of physical real estate or rights to display advertising on specific building facades.

### Problems with Prior Art

**Lack of Physical Asset Linking:** Existing NFT and blockchain systems can represent arbitrary digital tokens but provide no cryptographic proof the token creator actually owns the physical asset being tokenized. Anyone can mint an NFT claiming to represent advertising rights on the Empire State Building without proving they own or control that property.

**No Real-Time Verification:** AR content platforms need immediate verification that a proposed advertisement has valid authorization before displaying it. Current systems would require manual legal review of contracts and property ownership, which is too slow for real-time AR experiences.

**Absence of Geospatial Encoding:** Blockchain-based asset tokens do not encode precise spatial boundaries, elevation data, and facade orientations needed to definitively establish whether a specific AR placement falls within the tokenized rights.

**Insufficient Identity Verification:** Current systems do not adequately verify property owner identity before allowing rights tokenization. This creates risk of fraudulent rights claims and disputes over legitimate ownership.

**No Automated Royalty Distribution:** When advertising revenue is generated, manual payment processing is required. There is no automated, trustless mechanism for distributing royalties to rightful owners based on cryptographically verified ownership.

**Conflict Resolution Deficiencies:** When multiple parties claim overlapping spatial advertising rights, existing systems provide no technical mechanism for resolving disputes. Courts must intervene using traditional legal processes.

**Temporal Rights Management Inadequacy:** Advertising rights are often sold for specific time periods (months, years), but blockchain systems lack built-in support for time-limited rights that automatically expire and return to the property owner.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a comprehensive rights verification and management system specifically designed for AR advertising on physical properties:

**Cryptographic Property Ownership Verification:**
- Integration with government property deed registries via API connections
- Cross-referencing property ownership claims against official records
- Multi-factor identity verification for property owners:
  - Government-issued photo ID verification (driver's license, passport)
  - Utility bill or property tax statement upload proving property connection
  - Bank account verification demonstrating financial relationship to property
  - Video call identity confirmation for high-value properties
- Cryptographic signing of ownership claims using public-key infrastructure
- Storage of verified ownership credentials in tamper-proof database

### Implementation Details

**Property Owner Verification Workflow:**

1. **Initial Registration:**
   - Property owner creates account with email and password
   - System sends email verification link
   - Owner completes basic profile (name, address, phone)

2. **Identity Verification:**
   - Owner uploads government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport)
   - System extracts text via OCR and validates document authenticity
   - System performs facial recognition comparing ID photo to live selfie
   - System checks ID against fraud databases and sanctions lists

3. **Property Ownership Verification:**
   - Owner selects property from map interface or enters address
   - System queries county deed registry API for current ownership records
   - Owner uploads property deed, title insurance, or recent property tax statement
   - System cross-references uploaded documents with public records
   - For discrepancies, system escalates to manual review by verification team

4. **Financial Verification:**
   - Owner completes bank account verification via micro-deposit
   - System confirms bank account name matches verified identity
   - For high-value properties, owner completes video call with verification specialist

5. **Verification Approval:**
   - System grants verified status to property owner account
   - Verified status recorded on blockchain via smart contract call
   - Owner now authorized to mint spatial rights NFTs for their verified properties

**NFT Minting Workflow:**

1. **Zone Definition:**
   - Verified property owner accesses zone creation interface
   - Owner selects property from their verified properties list
   - Owner draws zone boundary on interactive map or uploads polygon WKT
   - System validates zone boundary falls within property footprint

2. **Metadata Preparation:**
   - System generates comprehensive zone metadata JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Empire State Building North Facade Premium",
     "description": "Premium AR advertising zone on north facade",
     "image": "ipfs://Qm.../zone-preview.jpg",
     "attributes": [
       {"trait_type": "Zone Type", "value": "Bulletin"},
       {"trait_type": "Width (feet)", "value": 48},
       {"trait_type": "Height (feet)", "value": 14},
       {"trait_type": "Elevation (feet)", "value": 520},
       {"trait_type": "Facade Direction", "value": "North"},
       {"trait_type": "Visibility Score", "value": 9},
       {"trait_type": "Traffic Exposure", "value": 10},
       {"trait_type": "Market Tier", "value": 1}
     ],
     "boundary_geometry_wkt": "POLYGON((-73.9857 40.7484 520, ...))",
     "property_address": "350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118",
     "property_deed_hash": "0xabc123..."
   }
   ```
   - System uploads metadata to IPFS
   - System calculates keccak256 hash of boundary geometry

3. **Smart Contract Interaction:**
   - Owner initiates mintSpatialRights transaction
   - Owner pays gas fees (typically 0.01-0.05 ETH on L2)
   - Smart contract verifies owner is verified property owner
   - Smart contract checks for boundary hash collision (duplicate zone prevention)
   - Smart contract mints NFT and emits SpatialRightsMinted event
   - NFT appears in owner's wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

4. **Marketplace Listing:**
   - Owner sets monthly rental rate for zone
   - Owner defines availability periods
   - Owner sets content restrictions and approval requirements
   - Zone becomes available for advertiser booking

   // }
   ```

**Embodiment 3: Disputed Ownership Resolution**

Two parties claim ownership of AR rights on same building:

- **Party A (Original Owner):** Claims they minted zone rights NFT #100 for building at 123 Main St
- **Party B (New Owner):** Claims they recently purchased the building and should control AR rights

**Dispute Process:**

1. **Dispute Filing:** Party B files dispute on chain:
   ```javascript
   await disputeContract.methods.fileDispute(
     100,  // zoneRightsTokenId
     partyAAddress,  // respondent
     "I purchased this property on 2024-09-15 and should own AR rights",
     "0xevidence123..."  // IPFS hash of deed showing purchase
   ).send({ from: partyBAddress });
   ```

2. **Automatic Freeze:** Smart contract freezes NFT #100 transfers
3. **Evidence Collection:**
   - Party A uploads: Original property deed, NFT minting transaction history
   - Party B uploads: Recent purchase deed, closing documents, title insurance

4. **Arbiter Review:** Designated arbiter (lawyer, title company, or DAO vote) reviews evidence:
   - Verifies Party B did purchase property on 2024-09-15
   - Notes Party A minted NFT before sale
   - Determines AR rights should transfer with property deed

5. **Resolution Execution:**
   ```javascript
   await disputeContract.methods.resolveDispute(
     disputeId,
     DisputeResolution.ClaimantWins  // Party B wins
   ).send({ from: arbiterAddress });
   ```

6. **Automatic Transfer:** Smart contract transfers NFT #100 from Party A to Party B
7. **Unfreeze:** NFT transfers unfrozen, Party B can now list zone for rental

**Embodiment 4: Fractional Ownership Investment**

Property owner wants to raise capital by selling fractional AR rights:

1. **Parent NFT:** Owner holds zone rights NFT #200 (prime Times Square location)
2. **Fractionalization:** Owner deploys FractionalARRights contract:
   ```javascript
   const fractionalContract = await FractionalARRights.deploy(
     200,  // parent zoneRightsTokenId
     10000,  // totalShares
     web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether')  // 1 ETH per share
   );
   ```

3. **Investor Purchases:** 100 investors buy shares:
   - Investor 1: 500 shares (5% ownership) for 500 ETH
   - Investor 2: 200 shares (2% ownership) for 200 ETH
   - ...
   - Total raised: 10,000 ETH

4. **Revenue Distribution:** When advertisers book the zone:
   - Monthly rent: $500,000 = ~200 ETH
   - Platform fee: 15% = 30 ETH
   - Shareholders receive: 170 ETH
   - Per-share dividend: 170 / 10,000 = 0.017 ETH per share

5. **Share Trading:** Investors can trade shares on secondary market:
   - Uniswap pool: ARZONE-200 / ETH
   - OpenSea listings for ARZONE-200 shares
   - Price discovery based on expected future revenue
